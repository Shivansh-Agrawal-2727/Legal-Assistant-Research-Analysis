# ⚖️ L.A.R.A – Legal Analysis Research Assistant

**L.A.R.A (Legal Analysis & Research Assistant)** is a **deployed, AI-powered legal research system for Indian law** that automates issue identification, case retrieval, statutory analysis, and structured legal drafting using a **multi-agent RAG architecture**.

🔗 **Live Streamlit Demo:** <https://lara-legal-assistant.streamlit.app/>  


## 🧠 Overview
**L.A.R.A (Legal Analysis & Research Assistant)** is an intelligent, Python-based backend system designed to support lawyers, researchers, and citizens in conducting in-depth legal research under Indian law.

Built on the concept of autonomous legal research agents, L.A.R.A automates the complete research pipeline—transforming natural-language queries into law-aware search terms, retrieving authoritative legal sources, and generating structured, citable legal analysis. Each response is automatically self-evaluated with a real-time confidence score to improve reliability and trust.

The system leverages LangGraph for modular, multi-agent orchestration and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to combine internal legal corpora with live web data.
In Lawyer Mode, L.A.R.A executes a sophisticated multi-node workflow involving issue extraction, planning, iterative retrieval, drafting, and self-critique, ensuring refined, high-quality legal outputs.

L.A.R.A supports two distinct workflows:

Citizen Mode: Simplified legal guidance focused on awareness, rights, and procedures.

Lawyer Mode: Professional-grade legal analysis with iterative reasoning, citations, and evaluation.

## 🚀 Features

- **Intelligent Query Rewriting**  
  Converts user queries into law-aware, retrieval-optimized search prompts.

- **Role-Based Agents**
  - **Citizen Mode:** General legal awareness using RAG + hybrid retrieval.
  - **Lawyer Mode:** Multi-node LangGraph workflow with issue extraction, planning, retrieval, drafting, critique, and refinement.

- **Hybrid Data Retrieval**  
  Combines FAISS-based vector search with live web lookup (Tavily Search API).

- **Iterative Multi-Agent Reasoning**  
  Lawyer mode dynamically refines answers through up to 3 critique iterations.

- **Structured Legal Analysis**  
  Synthesizes statutes, acts, and case law into clear, referenced outputs.

- **Citation System**  
  Each response includes citations for traceability and verification.

- **In-line Confidence Score**  
  Evaluates relevance, faithfulness, and clarity for every response.

- **Evaluation System**  
  Computes precision@5, recall@5, citation correctness, hallucination rate, and answer consistency.

- **ML Models**
  - Issue classifier: TF-IDF + Logistic Regression  
  - Semantic similarity: Sentence-Transformers

- **Test Endpoint**  
  Dedicated `/test_lawyer_agent` endpoint for validating lawyer workflows.
